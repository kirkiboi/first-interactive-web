            As time marches on, I grow more hesitant in facing what future has for me.
            I am no more strong. I am no more brave. I've gone to believe that life is not as resplindent as how I thought it would be.
            Life hurts. It pains. What I am more afraid of is that there is no one I have. This loneliness wraps me so warmly that it
            scares me so much. None will worry if I end it here. None will wonder what I'm doing. None will grief. These facts makes the voices
            in my head even louder. I might not make it till tomorrow. It scares me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've grown despondent of everything. I see no more value in the life I am living. It's as if I am in a maze with every bit of sense of 
            direction taken away from me. I am starting to think that I will fail to keep the promise I always have made to myself: "Death will find
            me alive"; I am now having doubts. There is still hope; there is still a light that pierces through these four-cornered walls I am trapped within; I will hold onto it
            ;I will still believe that when death steps onto my porch and knocks on the door twice, I will be there to open it and invite him in for a coffee.
